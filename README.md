# Padi
Highly opinionated React web and app framework.

## Problem
React is just a view library. Making it work requires alot of additional setup. This can prove to be difficult for beginners.

## Solution
A template that is highly opinionated so that beginners can have a foundation to build upon.

## Vision
- Battery included.(Routing, State management, etc)
- Best practices.(Duck pattern, immutable, storybook, etc)
- Logic sharing between web and app.
- CLI to help with development.
